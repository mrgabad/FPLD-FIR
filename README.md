# FPLD-FIR
The purpose of this lab is to introduce students to direct and transpose forms of Finite
Impulse Response (FIR) Digital Filters. Main objectives of this lab are to develop a
direct form FIR filter, a transpose FIR filter, a transpose FIR filter with pipelining, and
to compare balance, performance, power, and area optimizations.
